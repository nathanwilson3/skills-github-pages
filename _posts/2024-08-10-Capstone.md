The process of creating a github pages blog has been very difficult for me.  I've tried installing jekyll on my MacBook Air witht the M2 chip.  I can get all the other files and frameworks
such as ruby, bundler, and gem. But when I tried to install jekyll there is always an error, and none of the tutorials or problems other people have had work for my situation right now.  
So I will have to do it fully from the web, which is fine, although I'd really like the ability to add things to it from my computer in the instances I don't have access to the internet.
