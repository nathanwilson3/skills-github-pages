title: Computer Science Capstone 
---

My name is Nathan Wilson, and I'm currently in my final class at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my time here, I have learned a lot of fascinating concepts that have helped me on my journey to becoming a Software Engineer. I have mostly experienced ups, completing the majority of my courses with As or Bs. However, towards the end of my courses, particularly those focused on the core Computer Science curriculum, I struggled a great deal. This was largely due to working overseas, twelve hours a day, six days a week. As we were nearing the closure of the Embassy, I found myself working seven days a week. I ended up taking an eight-month break before starting again in January 2022. During this time, I was struggling financially and working 60-80 hours a week to catch up on bills, which led to me dropping out again in May 2022.

In 2023, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Saint Martin's University in Lacey, Washington, through a program called Washington Vets 2 Tech (WA Vets 2 Tech). This program served as a refresher for some of the courses I had already taken at SNHU. However, there were a few classes that were more focused on web development, and since Amazon was a partner in this program, I also took some classes specific to AWS services.
